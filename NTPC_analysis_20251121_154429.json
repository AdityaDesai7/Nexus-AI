      "content": "Listen to this article in summarized format Listen Loading... × × Subscribe to Unlock AI Briefing and Premium Content Subscribe Now What's Included Exclusive Stories Daily ePaper Access Smart Market Tools Curated Investment Ideas Ad-lite Experience Subscription ET Bureau The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed the Avantha Holdings 's appeal against state-owned NTPC ’s resolution plan for takeover of debt-ridden Jhabua Power . A Bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kumar and Alok Aradhe upheld the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s order that rejected Avantha Holdings' plea for a settlement proposal of the debt-ridden firm. Avantha Holdings is the promoter and shareholder of Avantha Power and Infrastructure, which holds 17.9% shares of Jhabua Power. The appellate tribunal in its July 2022 order held that the promoter who led to insolvency process of corporate debtor cannot claim to submit a resolution plan indirectly and ask the lenders to evaluate its resolution plan. NTPC has already acquired 600 MW thermal power plant of Jhabua Power in Seoni, Madhya Pradesh for Rs 925 crore and also implemented its resolution plan. Avantha Holdings had also sought the disqualification of NTPC under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , 2016, from the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process for Jhabua Power, saying the provision bars certain individuals and entities from submitting a resolution plan for a distressed company. Further, Avantha Holdings had challenged the decision of Jhabua Power's committee of creditors to reject its restructuring and settlement proposal for the debt-ridden company. It said that its settlement plan had not been considered by the CoC by any application of mind and it had been arbitrarily rejected. Live Events Besides, Avantha Holdings told the court that two joint ventures of NTPC – Ratnagiri Gas and Power and Konkan LNG – had already been classified as non-performing assets, and thus, NTPC was disqualified in the insolvency proceedings of Jhabua Power by virtue of Section 29A(c) and Section 29A(j) of the 2016 code. NTPC, however, argued that it was eligible to submit the Plan and CoC with a due deliberations on the Resolution Plan, approved it with 100% vote. The Canara Bank had classified Ratnagiri Gas and Power and Konkan LNG as non-performing assets in 2018, and by then, the one-year period from the date of commencement of insolvency proceedings had not elapsed, so disqualification under Section 29A(c) was not attracted, it said. The entire debt of Konkan LNG was settled through a one-time settlement in 2020, and all lenders had issued no due certificates as there was no old dues, the PSU argued. The Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal in 2019 had initiated insolvency proceedings against Jhabua Power on a petition by FLSmidth and appointed Abhilash Lal as the Resolution Professional. While Avantha Holdings in 2020 had made a proposal to the committee of creditors (CoC) for the settlement of debt owed by Jhabua Power, the lenders in June 2021 found the NTPC resolution plan to be compliant. Even the tribunal in 2021 approved the NTPC's plan as it found it feasible and viable. It rejected the Avantha Holdings' settlement plan for being commercially unviable and not prudent. Also, the NCLT rejected Avantha Holdings’ application seeking the NTPC ’s disqualification. Even the NCLAT rejected Avantha Holdings' appeal, saying “something which is not permissible directly by virtue of prohibition under Section 29A for submitting resolution plan by the promoters, cannot be permitted to be done indirectly. Further, the commercial wisdom of the CoC, is not liable to be judicially reviewed,” the appellate tribunal held. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!
